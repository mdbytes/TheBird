# TheBird
A LAMP full stack application to provide the basic framework of a social network called "The Bird".  It was originally written for educational purposes and is used for ongoing instruction.

<p>In its present form, the simple application provides for the following use cases:</p>

<ol>
<li>User registration with persistence to MYSQL database</li>
<li>User sign in to access application</li>
<li>User session management with login and logout</li>
<li>Ability for users to review their own posts and the posts of others</li>
<li>Ability for users to review hashtags of posts</li>
<li>Users can see list of other users to follow</li>
</ol>

<p>The application was originally developed in 2017 and was updated in 2024 to reflect PHP 7 with object-oriented programming.  Of course, future refinements are possible and will be made as need arise. Composer was also added in 2024 to utilize modern PHP package management.</p>
